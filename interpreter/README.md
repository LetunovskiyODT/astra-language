# ASTRA Interpreter Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of the ASTRA programming language interpreter.

## Purpose

The ASTRA interpreter serves several important purposes:

1. **Rapid Development**: Allows for quick testing and prototyping without full compilation
2. **Interactive Environment**: Provides a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for interactive development
3. **Simulation Environment**: Enables simulation of spacecraft and UAV systems for testing
4. **Educational Tool**: Helps users learn the ASTRA language with immediate feedback

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Interpreter
- Implement lexer and parser (shared with compiler)
- Create runtime value representation
- Implement basic expression evaluation
- Add support for variables and simple statements

### Phase 2: Control Flow and Functions
- Implement control structures (if, loops, etc.)
- Add function definition and calling
- Implement scope management
- Add module system

### Phase 3: Specialized Features
- Implement aerospace-specific types and operations
- Add concurrency support
- Implement real-time constraints simulation
- Add safety feature validation

### Phase 4: Interactive Environment
- Create REPL interface
- Implement debugging capabilities
- Add visualization for aerospace data
- Implement simulation controls

## Directory Structure

- `/src` - Source code for the interpreter
- `/include` - Header files
- `/lib` - Libraries used by the interpreter
- `/tests` - Test suite for the interpreter
- `/repl` - Interactive environment implementation

## Usage

*To be added*

## Simulation Capabilities

The interpreter will include simulation capabilities for:

- Orbital mechanics
- Spacecraft dynamics
- Sensor data generation
- Environmental conditions
- Communication systems

This allows testing ASTRA programs in a simulated environment before deployment to real hardware.

## Integration with Development Tools

The interpreter will integrate with:

- Code editors and IDEs
- Visualization tools
- Debugging interfaces
- Testing frameworks

## Dependencies

*To be determined*
