# ASTRA Programming Language

ASTRA is a specialized programming language designed for controlling spacecraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This project aims to create a high-efficiency, safety-focused language for developing software used in spacecraft control, satellite systems, interorbital transfers, and autonomous drone flights.

## Project Overview

The ASTRA language is designed with the following key features:

- **Easy to learn and understand** for space engineers
- **High-speed compilation** with minimal memory usage
- **Efficient support** for multi-threaded data processing and asynchronous computing
- **Strong modular approach** to development
- **Type safety** and protection against accidental variable changes
- **Specialized capabilities** for space and aviation:
  - Fast vector operations and spatial coordinates
  - Special operations for trajectory calculations and course corrections
  - Rapid response mechanisms for external events
  - Simple ways to describe space and atmospheric condition models
  - Built-in procedures for simulating objects in space and atmosphere

## Project Structure

- `/compiler` - ASTRA language compiler implementation
- `/interpreter` - ASTRA language interpreter
- `/docs` - Language specification and documentation
- `/examples` - Example ASTRA programs
- `/tools` - Development tools and utilities

## Development Phases

1. **Design Phase**: Architecture design and first specification version
2. **Core Implementation**: Basic language core, fundamental constructs, and compiler prototype
3. **Advanced Features**: Formal verification support, bug tracking integration, and CI/CD infrastructure

## Safety Features

- Formal verification at source code level
- Automatic algorithm correctness checking
- Detailed exception and error analysis
- Comprehensive logging system
