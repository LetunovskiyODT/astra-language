# ASTRA Compiler Architecture

## Overview

The ASTRA compiler transforms ASTRA source code into efficient executable code. It is designed to be cross-platform, supporting Linux, Windows, and macOS, with a focus on generating optimized code for various target architectures including x86_64, ARMv7, and MIPS.

## Compiler Pipeline

The ASTRA compiler follows a traditional multi-stage compilation process:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Converts source code into tokens
2. **Syntax Analysis**: Parses tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
3. **Semantic Analysis**: Performs type checking and semantic validation
4. **Intermediate Representation**: Converts AST to an optimizable IR
5. **Optimization**: Applies various optimization passes
6. **Code Generation**: Produces target-specific machine code
7. **Linking**: Combines object files with libraries to create executables

## Key Components

### 1. Frontend

- **Lexer**: Tokenizes source code
- **Parser**: Builds AST from tokens
- **Semantic Analyzer**: Performs type checking and semantic validation
- **IR Generator**: Converts AST to intermediate representation

### 2. Middle-end (Optimizer)

- **Analysis Passes**: Data flow analysis, control flow analysis
- **Transformation Passes**: Constant folding, dead code elimination, loop optimization
- **Aerospace-specific Optimizations**: Vector operation optimization, trajectory calculation optimization

### 3. Backend

- **Code Generator**: Produces target-specific machine code
- **Register Allocator**: Efficiently assigns variables to registers
- **Instruction Scheduler**: Optimizes instruction ordering
- **Binary Emitter**: Produces final executable format

## Safety Features

The compiler includes several safety-focused features:

- **Static Analysis**: Detects potential runtime errors at compile time
- **Formal Verification**: Validates critical code sections against specifications
- **Resource Analysis**: Ensures memory and CPU usage meet requirements
- **Timing Analysis**: Verifies real-time constraints can be met

## Performance Considerations

The compiler is designed to:

- Minimize compilation time
- Generate compact executables
- Produce code with predictable performance characteristics
- Optimize for specific aerospace hardware platforms

## Cross-compilation Support

The ASTRA compiler supports cross-compilation for various embedded platforms commonly used in spacecraft and UAVs:

- **Radiation-hardened processors**
- **Flight control computers**
- **Sensor processing units**
- **Communication systems**

## Development Tools Integration

The compiler provides interfaces for integration with:

- **IDEs**: Code completion, error highlighting
- **Debuggers**: Source-level debugging
- **Profilers**: Performance analysis
- **CI/CD Systems**: Automated testing and deployment

## Implementation Strategy

The compiler will be implemented in a systems programming language (such as Rust or C++) to ensure performance and reliability. It will use a modular architecture to allow for easy extension and maintenance.

## Future Directions

- **Just-in-Time Compilation**: For dynamic code execution
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Leveraging specialized hardware for compilation
- **Cloud Compilation**: Distributed compilation for large projects
- **AI-assisted Optimization**: Using machine learning to improve code generation
